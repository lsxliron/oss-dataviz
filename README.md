## Open Source Visualizations

Final project for Data Visualization at the CUNY Graduate Center. 

## Running the project

Install the dependencies:

`bower install`

In order to serve the files locally using d3, we'll need to run a webserver:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

Navigate to `0.0.0.0:8000` and run the Parallel Coordinates example.
